## Objective: 
To demonstrate your understanding of git commands, git-GitHub integration, usage of GitHub Actions for creating a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline. 
## Set of activities:
* Setup a project repository in your local system, and initialize the repo using git. The project can include a simple Web application or a Microservice, developed using any programming language of your choice. 

* Demonstrate the following git commands on the repo: init, status, add, log, commit, branch, switch, merge, stash, reset and diff. 
c. Create a GitHub account and a GitHub repository. Demonstrate integration between git and GitHub, by pushing the local repo to GitHub.

* For the repo created in GitHub, create a workflow using GitHub Actions and demonstrate the following: Build Job, Test Job, Lint Job, and integration with SonarQube or SonarCloud. Any changes made to the source code should automatically invoke the workflow, and execute the pipeline. Demonstrate both clean build / clean test scenarios and errors during the build / test. 

* Lastly, prepare a word document containing the assignment details (screenshots of the application are required, along with explanation). Highlight clearly the contribution of each group member in executing the assignment. Upload the file as <groupid.docx> or <groupid.pdf> into the portal. Note that only one student needs to upload the file representing the group. No need for Individual submissions.
